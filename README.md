## Description

This application allows users to look for meals based on different regions, giving them the chance to experience the rich diversity of global cuisine. Users can look up recipes using keywords and ingredients. The software will provide users with a list of recipes as well as a list of required ingredients and preparation instructions. Users can set up multiple accounts and keep their favourite recipes there so they can access them later by reopening the app. Users can also create and delete accounts as needed. Users can also examine the calories in their planned meals and schedule meals for up to a week. Additionally, they can add or remove shopping to-do lists.
